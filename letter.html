    <h4>Dear Kachi,</h4>  
        <p>I trust this meets you well. We couldn't catch up for lunch again so I decided to write you instead. I know you will laugh and call me cheesy but we still have pending <i>gist</i>.</p> 
        <p>Remember we were talking about how automation, digital platforms, and other innovations are changing the fundamental nature of work. To be honest, this is causing considearble anxiety and of course, with good reason. We couldn't have predicted the pandemic and it seems as though we all learnt the true meaning of digital transformation and because of this, many organizations realized it's importance. These organizations seem to have looked and are still looking to technology to help them survive, recover and grow.</p>
        <p>Now, because of this increasing adoption of technolgies, I really worry that the role of humans in the economy will shrink drastically thereby wiping out millions of jobs. On the brighter side, these technolgies might also create jobs. This will mean that we all understand these shifts and plan for the future accordingly or be left behind.</p>
        <p>I don't want to make this too lengthy so I will stop here and we'll have the rest of the conversation when you touch down. My love to your family.</p>
